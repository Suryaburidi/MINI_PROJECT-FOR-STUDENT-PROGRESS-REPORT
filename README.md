# MINI_PROJECT-FOR-STUDENT-PROGRESS-REPORT
This project is a Student Progress Tracker System made using Python. The program asks the user to enter a student's name, class, roll number, and subject marks. It adds all the marks, finds the total and average, and then gives a grade based on the average marks.
